# My Pebble Apps
These are the Pebble apps that I use on my Pebble Time Steel.
I decided to make a backup of these apps due to the Pebble app store going offline by the end of 2017.
Feel free to download the applications for your own use on your own Pebble hardware.

##  Warning
These apps are 100% compatible with the Pebble Time Steel. They may not be compatible with other models of Pebble smart watches (such as the Pebble round or the Pebble classic). Some of this will work on other models but I have not tested them personally.
